# CapstoneProject-EC-ElGamal
This repository is designed to help understand elliptic curves and cryptosystems at a basic level. It includes implementations of elliptic curves, ElGamal encryption, elliptic curve ElGamal encryption, and the baby-step giant-step algorithm for attacks. Most of the code is available for both real numbers and finite fields.
